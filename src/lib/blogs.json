    "content": "As our blood pressure comes down and bills come in from what many people (>2) said was the best wedding they have ever attended, Colin and I are now sitting on an eleven-hour plane from Boston to Honolulu. As soon as it was confirmed that we wouldn‚Äôt be deboarding this plane for the third time in 24 hours, we buttoned on our new neck pillow‚Äîour inaugural purchase as husband and wife‚Äîand knocked out for the first hour. We just ate a wonderful cinnamon apple crepe and scrambled egg meal (with the best honeydew melon I‚Äôve had in a while). Colin has taken custody of the neck pillow for a solo nap part two, and I am beginning our travel diary. This was requested by my mom, who is back at home in NC expecting a 'detailed account of everything we do'.<br><br><aside><strong>Aside:</strong> There was just an intercom announcement: ‚ÄúWe are paging a passenger named Zoe Huang. We have your Kumon folder up here.‚Äù<br>Poor Zoe tried ditching her Kumon bag before the Hawaii vacation and they got her ü§£.</aside><br><h3>Night one in Hawaii (Logan Airport Hilton)</h3>The first time we deboarded was 8am yesterday. After an hour delay (mechanical issues), we got on the plane, strapped on the neck pillow, and were out within 5 minutes. About an hour later, I was shaken awake for what I expected to be a meal service. Actually, it was the flight attendant shaking us awake, informing us about the first deboard. We hadn‚Äôt even left the gate. Apparently, as the plane was waiting for signoff from the mechanical issues, the interior had gotten too hot for passengers to continue waiting. While we assured the attendant that we were perfectly fine and that this was great napping temperature, we found ourselves back in terminal E11 for the second time. We deboard, sit back down in the terminal, and start calling Airbnb, Hertz, and Hawaiian Airlines to minimize itinerary damage.<br><br>A little while later, we spot Tegan walking to her gate! We flag her down and are significantly happier to have a buddy to wait with as Hawaiian figures out their issues. About two hours in E11 later, the plane is finally ready. We board and settle in for the second time. About another hour later, we‚Äôre informed that while they were waiting on the final maintenance signoff, the cabin crew timed out, and FAA regulations prohibit them from working the eleven-hour flight. We deboard again. At the gate, we see the entire plane queue at the Hawaiian gate desk. Colin and I decide we want nothing to do with this line and instead go to the very front and sit in a chair where we can hear all the conversations to try to figure out what they‚Äôre telling people. We hear that they are rebooking the whole flight for 6am the next day and comping a night in the Hilton attached to the airport. The ridiculously long line is to get food vouchers and hotel info.<br><br>In between people being helped, I throw the attendant a clarifying question and she asks if we just want to skip the line. Yes. We jump up there, get our $80 worth of airport food vouchers and hotel info. Annoyingly, Hawaiian makes us wait at E11 for 2 more hours, but this gives Colin time to try and salvage the missed bookings due to the delay. We pick up some to-go Davio‚Äôs, a really nice steakhouse in the airport, with the vouchers. We head back to the hotel, get a workout in at the gym, and spend the rest of the evening in the jacuzzi with McKinley (3-year-old birthday girl). We end the unconventionally and unexpectedly fun night with Davio‚Äôs overlooking a beautiful Logan Airport and Boston harbor.",
